The aim of this project is to manipulate of a set of blinds/covers (1-24) from a central place.

One blind/cover requires two relays. First gives power supply, and second is responsible for direction.
For that purpose, 8-relay boards were used.

Functions:
- onfigurable time to open and close (file or from code).
- configurable PIn number for control a power and direction relay (file or from code)
- configurable name and groups (file and code)
- possible to debulg or see a log via RS or file (log is save to file if needed)
- possible to enable webServer or MySensor device
